# DAGMCX: A GPU-enabled version of [DAGMC](https://github.com/dagmcx)

This project enables hardware-accelerated, double precision ray
tracing on tessellations of CAD geometry on GPUs. The aim of this project
is to enable greatly enhanced ray tracing performance on CAD-based geometry
for scientific applications that require robust intersection routines and
particle tracking algorithms for particle transport.
